# Why Did You Choose Your Major?

During my time at De Anza College, I was part of the Statistics Club. We were curious about why students were choosing their respective majors, and we decided to use it as our research subject for our club to do. We consulted a statistics professor to conduct our research, and reached out to several clubs to spread our survey. Details regarding our project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1u1yvmTxCxmIlY9GJZfXTCWgPUVCzr2D__NH_AGBUzxk/edit#slide=id.p3).

Through this project, we used one-way tables, two-way tables, and population proportion to perform our statistical analysis. We mainly used Excel as a means of calculation, but we also used other programming methods (such as Python) for data cleanup. Below I've highlighted some findings that I find particularly interesting: 

- We have found a lot of students have chosen their majors due to it being their own passion (regardless of their majors), and language and cultural barriers seem to be of concern specifically for students who major in business or STEM-related majors.

- We also found it interesting how a majority of students are choosing majors that are not independent on their parents' or legal guardians' major. We hypothesize this relates to how many students are choosing majors out of their own passion, so the influence of a parent or legal guardian is not significant in choosing thier major.

We also acknowledge that this project comes with flaws: our outreach was limited to only De Anza College students, and not many would be willing to fill our surveys. Hence, some bias may be presented in our findings. However, it was a good learning experience, and we were surprised that some of our assumptions before doing this project were challenged or even changed. We also became better versed in using statistical analysis and also in teamwork.
