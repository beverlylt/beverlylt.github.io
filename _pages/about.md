A data enthusiast that is extremely interested in working as a data analyst/ scientist, and have experience with R and Python programming. I am also continuing to learn SQL at the moment. I have also took classes in machine learning, linear modelling, data science and probability. Always up for a challenge or to learn, so feel free to reach out to do projects together!
